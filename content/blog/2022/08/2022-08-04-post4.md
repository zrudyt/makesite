<!-- title: stdin and stdout with tar -->
<!-- tags: scripting makesite SSH -->

While archiving, we can specify stdout as the output file so another command
in a pipe can read it as stdin and process the archive.

This technique will transfer data through a Secure Shell (SSH) connection, for
example:

    $ tar cvf - files/ | ssh user@example.com "tar xv -C Documents/"

In the preceding example, the files/directory is added to a tar archive which
is output to stdout (denoted by -) and extracted to the Documents folder on
the remote system.
